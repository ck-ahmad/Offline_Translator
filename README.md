# 🌐 Offline Translator App

An efficient Flask-based offline translation web application that translates text between multiple languages without requiring internet access. Built for speed, privacy, and reliability using local machine translation models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔁 **Multi-language support** for translation
- 🌐 **100% offline** – no internet dependency
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** – data never leaves your device
- ⚡ **Fast translation** with preloaded local models
- 🖥️ **User-friendly interface** built with Flask and Jinja2

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack & Dependencies

The application uses the following Python libraries:

| Library         | Purpose                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Flask           | Web framework                          |
| Transformers    | Pretrained language translation models |
| Torch           | Deep learning backend for Transformers |
| SentencePiece   | Tokenization support for translation   |
| Langcodes       | Language code mapping and handling     |
| pyttsx3 *(optional)* | Text-to-speech (for speech output)   |

> Ensure all libraries are installed locally before running the app.

### ✅ Installation Command:

```bash
pip install flask transformers torch sentencepiece langcodes pyttsx3

## 🧠 Model Usage (Example)

This app uses **MarianMT** models by Hugging Face:

```python
from transformers import MarianMTModel, MarianTokenizer

model_name = 'Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de'
tokenizer = MarianTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = MarianMTModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save locally
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./models/en-de')
model.save_pretrained('./models/en-de')
```

Modify `translator.py` to load the saved model from the `./models/` directory to work offline.

---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

## 🌍 How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Select source and target languages.
3. Enter the text you want to translate.
4. Click **Translate**.
5. (Optional) Click **Speak** to hear the result via text-to-speech.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Ensure translation models are pre-downloaded and saved locally.
* No data is sent over the internet – completely offline functionality.
* Optional TTS feature uses `pyttsx3` for converting translated text to speech.

Let me know if you want to:

- Include screenshots
- Add Docker support
- Customize for a specific translation model (e.g., MBart)
- Include setup instructions for Windows/Linux

I can help generate the exact `translator.py` logic too if you need it!
